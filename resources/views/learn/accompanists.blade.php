                    <p>
                        Playing an instrument on your own (solo) can be rewarding and challenging (especially the Piano, Organ or Harp) but, for most instruments, almost all the music written for them requires other players too.  Much of the repertoire involves a solo instrument with an accompanying part. Often, this will be written for Piano but sometimes it is intended to be an orchestra.  However, but most students will not get the opportunity to play solos with an orchestra until they are much further along in their musical development so, instead, the piano is an obvious replacement. Playing with a piano helps you to learn to play with others and enhances your playing in any small concerts, festivals or in exams (In fact, a piano accompanist is required for most music exams).

                        If you are a pianist yourself, accompanying can be great fun â€“ and one of the best and most enjoyable ways to learn to accompany, to play with others and to improve your reading and rhythmic skills is to play piano duets, ideally with somebody who is better then you!
