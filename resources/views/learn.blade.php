    <div class="row info-row col-md-offset-1 col-md-10">
        <h4><strong>Why you should learn to play an instrument</strong> (or to sing)</h4>
        <p>First of all, it&rsquo;s fun! &nbsp;Making music, especially with other people, is one of the most enjoyable, rewarding and beneficial activities imaginable. &nbsp;The more you do it and the better you get at it, the more pleasure you will get out of it &ndash; for the rest of your life!</p>
        <p>It has been proved, time and time again, that musical activities offer immense educational benefits. &nbsp;Children who are actively involved in music develop greater concentration, self-discipline, attention span, confidence, self-esteem, problem-solving skills, creative thinking, mental agility, physical coordination, team-work, sense of responsibility to and respect for others, etc., etc. &nbsp;Music helps with reading, it helps with maths, it helps with languages &ndash; in fact, it has been proved that musically active children outperform others in just about every aspect of their education. &nbsp;(Articles on this subject will be posted regularly on our Facebook page.)</p>
        <p>Not only that &ndash; music-making is a great social activity. &nbsp;Playing in orchestras and ensembles and singing in choirs are superb ways to meet people and make new friends, especially if you move to a new school, or when you go to college or university, or move to a new place later in life. &nbsp;It also opens the door to countless opportunities for travel and to visit amazing places.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s remember, it&rsquo;s not just the process of learning to play (or to sing) that brings all these benefits and advantages. &nbsp;Learning to play is just a skill (albeit a fairly complex one) and a means to an end. &nbsp;The real benefits and advantages come when you reach a standard that enables you to play with others and to enjoy being part of a musical &ldquo;experience&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><strong><br>Countless adults will tell you how much they regret that they never had a chance to learn to play &ndash; or that they gave up far too soon and never managed to reach a decent standard. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t become one of those! &nbsp;Everybody is capable of reaching a level at which playing or singing with others can provide a lifetime of joyful, meaningful and emotionally rewarding experiences!</strong></p>
