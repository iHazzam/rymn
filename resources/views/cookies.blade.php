            <h1>Cookies Policy</h1>
            <p>Our website uses cookies. By using our website, you consent to our use of cookies with accordance to this policy</p>
            <h2>About cookies</h2>
            <p>	A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning to a website.</p>
            <h2>Our Cookies</h2>
            <p>RYMN only uses session cookies on our website. These expire when you close a browser session and are not used to track you. We only use these to recoginise if you have closed a pop-up or not, to avoid informing you of our deals on every page!</p>

            <h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
            <p>Users who wish not to use cookies can block them in their browser in the settings menu, or delete RYMN's cookies by closing the browser session, or browsing in incognito mode.</p>
            <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
            <p>If we decide to change our cookies policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
